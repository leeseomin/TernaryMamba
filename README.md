# TernaryMamba: 
A ternary quantized language model based on the Mamba architecture, enabling model compression and efficient inference by representing weights as {-1, 0, 1}.


### Ternary Quantization
The model's weights are quantized to three values: {-1, 0, 1}. This enables model compression and efficient inference by representing the weights in a compact form.

### Mamba Architecture
The language model is constructed using Mamba blocks, which consist of:
- LayerNorm
- SwiGLU (Swish activation + Gated Linear Unit)
- Mamba State Space Model (SSM)

### OpenWebText Dataset
- The model is trained on 30~50% of the OpenWebText dataset.
- The data is preprocessed and stored in binary format, which is loaded during training.

### Model Training
- The model is trained using the Adam optimizer.
- During the training process:
  - Train/val losses are periodically evaluated.
  - The loss graph is updated.
